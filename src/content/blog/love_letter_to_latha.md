Recently, I've watched [Aarambham](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31436476/), a Telugu sci-fi drama thriller. Out of all the things, I've loved the tribute that the director pays to the protagonist's mother. It's so well written, directed and shot that it shed tears instantly. We'll never get a chance to appreciate what our mothers have done to us. This is an attempt to write a love letter to my mom, my universe, my first love and the person who made me understand the meaning of unfathomable love.

I always address my mom with her name and I've been fortunate to sleep along side with my mom till this age. I'm a late bloomer and it's only when I started managing things on my own after shifting to a flat I've realised how non-trivial it is to manage your daily household chores. Thanks, Latha for doing these boring things effortlessly with such intense love and focus.

I've always wanted to take my parents out and my mom refuses almost every time. I understood that she's a tad bit insecure that she doesn't have enough clothing or jewellery. I'm fortunate to give her back the freedom to go out when she wants. My recent luxury is walking behind my mom who's all fancy and take these pictures.

Ever noticed how your mom never runs out of topics to talk. She always have some gossip to share and some point to make. It's just so comforting to talk anything with my mom. I started having random debates with my mom about the things she's super opinionated with. It's very fun to see how effortlessly she wins with the most powerful cards that she possess (‡§•‡§™‡•ç‡§™‡§°‡§º ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§Ç‡§ó‡§æ). I even brainstorm my future goals with her. Thanks Latha for listening my trash talk.
