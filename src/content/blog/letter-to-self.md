Dear Mohan,

Walking down memory lane is always a bit scary but it's only the way to keep reminding you of the progress you've made. I've seen you getting stronger over the months and I'm happy for both of us, sometimes you fail to see things in the long term but you're doing completely okay.

I get it, doing this act of introspection comes with its problems. As you rediscover the feelings you had back then it would be like a mystery box that can either bring back the pain or the joy to restore the purpose that you've had that somewhere along the line went dormant. I mean it's a very human thing to happen, as your brain is a dumb fuck creature, that keeps throwing you some random things.

To talk about progress, you've understood the importance of caring for yourself, being conscious of your flaws and trying to play life by your rules. You've understood the importance of consistency, discipline and fitness. You've read and understood how to navigate life through your goals and what it is to play long-term games.

To remind you again, you've kept your priorities and habits/actions accordingly -

1. Movement (currently GYM) - As you've decided to give your best to your work and beyond it gets unhealthy. To deal with something unhealthy, you must be as healthy as possible.
2. Eating healthy - You've seen the changes that your food intake has brought and the importance of eating balanced nutrition meals.
3. FamILY - If there's anything you've learnt after failing to get hold love in your life is the source of it. The abundance supply of it is right inside your home itself. You're just not skilled enough to make sense of this.
4. Work - The intensity of this might differ over weeks, but the joy, pain, and love it brings you is simply irreplaceable. It almost feels like you've married to it.
5. Art - You're highly energetic and still learning how to channel this and so far reading and doodling have been proven to keep the highs stable.
6. Downtime - As much as you enjoy the time doing all this, you also need some breaks from yourself.

I know this must be very thrilling and happy, but you still have a few growth areas to talk about. I feel you should focus more of your energy towards improving these

1. Seeing your emotions as they are. There's no wrong or right about a feeling and if you don't teach yourself to see them objectively you keep digging the grave holes and waste your energy in unwanted introspections. In short, fuck the thoughts/feelings.
2. Stop Waiting for magic. If you keep expecting things will be fixed over the weekend, then what's the point of the whole week?
3. Embracing the discomfort.
4. Stop Comparing yourself.
5. Step out of your verbal comfort zone

Quotes that keep bursting into your head

1. Hell yeah or no!
2. If you chase peaks of happiness, later you will get valleys of emptiness.
