I'll use this as a space to keep dumping ideas to build over the weekend.

- Chloe's Garden - [Link](https://www.chloeyan.me/)
  - beautiful garden to showcase cute little micro designs built with CSS.
- Amie's calendar widget - [Link](https://amie.so/routines/andrew-huberman)
  - Love how they chose this topic to write about huberman's routine. I just like that widget on the left.
- G3dkr Personal Blog - [Link](https://gd3.kr/)
  - Like this photo grid animation on the right simple yet had its own flavour.
