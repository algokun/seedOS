# Welcome

Hello, I'm [Mohan](https://twitter.com/algokun) and I'm a little bit of everything @ [MetaForms](https://workhack.ai/) (previously WorkHack)

I always wished for a corner for myself to put everything's on my head. If you happen to know me, you know how seriously I document the stories of life, but when it comes to putting a bit of something in words, I often stumble. So, I'll be writing here as a habit.

### Now

These are the things that I'm chasing right now and I'm investing all my energy here -

1. Working out
   - If there's an activity that I wish to do every day till my last breath, it would be this.
   - This is one such activity that keeps me sane and calm. I'm trying to fix my body and the way how I look. This is just to satisfy my bloody ego.
2. Building Reliable and Scalable Products
   - After failing countless times trying to build something very reliable, stable and can easily scale, I'm chasing this to feed my prolonged hunger towards it.
3. Doodling

   - I like the art of doodling. I haven't developed any style or taste towards the things I like. I'm just a mere beginner trying to get the most out of drawing those lines and curves.
   - I like it for its calm and soothing feeling that puts me in a deep focus and creative zone.
   - I don't have any plans on how to move forward, I just enjoy it as a hobby.
