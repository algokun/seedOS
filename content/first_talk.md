Last weekend, I was fortunate to have an experience I will cherish for the rest of my life. I was invited to a college near my hometown to talk about cool things happening in tech. I accepted the invitation because it felt challenging, and I wanted to sign up to embarrass myself in front of folks I would never meet after the talk.

I wanted to talk about AI and the learnings from playing around with it for over a year. I jotted down my thoughts and never went back to expand. Just before onboarding, I learned there'll be around 200 folks joining the talk. I'm scared and sleepless. It's not that I can't talk; I have always fancied doing something like this. Back in college, I saw [[siddish]] do the same, which inspired me. I kept telling myself I wanted to do something like this.

Just about to sleep, I got a random idea, and the dots could be connected. I started writing the outline, which gave me enough courage to sleep. I spent over an hour making a raw [presentation](https://slides.com/mohan-2/ai-driven-engineering-8c75c3/edit) out of the outline in the morning. To my surprise, the hardest part for me was bragging about myself. I want to be precise about how much bragging I want to do because that neither sounds too much nor undersells me.

I got shit scared after seeing 200 folks in the room. I read about it [somewhere](https://www.readtheprofile.com/p/why-the-worlds-most-confident-people) that if you can't find confidence, pretend to be someone who has it. I tried to apply the same; I even started to speak a different accent. It just took me around a minute to adjust; after that, I was in flow and forgot that I was even scared.

I felt very grateful for the whole experience, and it'll be exceptional because I will remember this as one of those moments when I overcame my fear. I'm unsure about the value added, but I hope one of them felt that they learned something.
