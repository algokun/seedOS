If you're a fan of Marvel, you know what a canon event is! but for those who don't - it's a life event that's pivotal to character development as a person - that redefines who you are.

Here are my canon events in random order (I'm lazy, I might re-order them someday :yawns)

- **2012** - Watched Avengers
- **2013** - My First Personal Computer
- **Aug 2014** - Vidya Teacher
- **Feb 2015** - My first crush
- **Dec 2016** - Hey Sumanth
- **Jan 2017** - Meeting Mani
- **Oct 2017** - Getting my first laptop
- **Apr 2019** - Hello Yash (he claims to be my protege)
- **Jul 2019** - Meeting [Siddish](https://x.com/siddish_)
  - It was my sophomore year of college, and I was, as usual, stoked about CS and life in general and felt very sad to find people who matched my level of curiosity. Everyone felt like NPCs chasing campus placements, and no one gave a fuck about these things. We lacked this collaborative culture.
  - I ran into Siddish, and life's never been the same. He's a straightforward guy - demure, autodidact and cracked. His basics are very sorted, and those conversations about reasoning, math and thinking in general brought back my enthusiasm.
  - Every interaction destroyed my conventional wisdom, and I have been rebuilding myself ever since. He played a major role in shaping my character. I used to be an arrogant jerk cursed with knowledge, and having seen Siddish and how modest a person can be even with all the ocean full of wisdom, I felt shit.
  - If you're reading this, Siddish, I wish meeting you be an absolute point of my life. To the good old days 🥂

- **Feb 2020** - Losing Grandpa
