This note is a work in progress, and the thoughts are streamed from my anxiety. 

Around August 2023, I hit a major roadblock in my life. I felt clueless about everything. I thought it was one of those days when you pent up emotions, and they burst open and thunder over your head, and that's true. 

It all started with a questioning mode, slowly progressing to taking everything very seriously and losing control over the conspiracy theories that the mind creates about ourselves. 

I took a break from everything and sat under the tree. I just sat there and let my train of thought decide the journey. I told myself seriously to play the role of a passenger. It started from my childhood memories to the recent ones, and the beauty of this exercise is to remind yourself that you're just [[The Nothing Theory |nothing]], and the everyday living and the routines around it will always make you feel that you're something. 

My work makes me an engineer, and the lovely people around me make me a particular person filled with love, but in reality, I'm just nothing in this ample void space. The funny thing is that no one can answer this question except you. I finally discovered this coping mechanism of zooming out loud, making your problems feel like quarks.
