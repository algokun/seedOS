Lately, I've been obsessed out [bret victor's](https://worrydream.com/) creations and this note is coming straight after the adreline rush that you get after watching his videos.

It's always very hard to finish watching his videos completely. The moment you see the demo of an interface, it literally blows your mind. You start to question everything starting form how the fuck did he even think about it and what does it take to build?

I think after jotting down the timeline of the videos I watched, it all made sense.

- He gave himself a lot of time to try out different things - starting from programming, animation and what not.
- Then he started to build his own belief engine very religiously and Having an oracle prophecy and going places to fix once that's violated.
- He kept doing this and then gave him self a space to imagine how a future looks like with all his beliefs are perfectly in place and he kept talking about it in almost all [talks](https://vimeo.com/115154289).
- It took him a whole decade to make the prophecy real and you can see from a [video recently](https://youtu.be/_gXiVOmaVSo?t=907) where he shows how he plays around with molecular structures of a protien.

I guess this is what it means to play long term and doing your life's best work.
