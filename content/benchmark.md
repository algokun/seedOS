It was the first week of March, and our first company was off-site. We had a small activity where every team was supposed to drop a shoe from a line, and the winner was the one who went the farthest. Our strategy was to use the whole body height, but we realized it was impossible and stuck to the upper body height. After the first round, we were shown the average height other teams have crossed. This just changed our strategy, and we went back and started to think about how to use the whole body's height, and, yeah, we finally cracked the solution.

When I ponder this, it brings me back to a funny story that happened when I went for a walk on a Sunday morning. I noticed an old man, almost in his 80s, dressed up like he was about to give his interview. I asked his age and why he dressed as he did, and his response shook me. He's in his 90s, and it turns out he's a retired scientist who worked in ISRO, and those are his comfort clothes. He told me about a little project he's working on and almost got the patents ready when I asked him what he's been doing lately.

He showed me his projectâ€”a machine designed to measure the stress/strain applied on an object. His lifelong passion for science had driven him to create this device. He proudly displayed his latest prototype, which could connect to our mobile phones and generate a graph with the recorded data. It was a testament to his unwavering curiosity and dedication to his craft. I told myself that's how I should die.

That was a hell of a day. It was my first time meeting someone of that age, and almost all the people of his age I encountered were either bedridden or stuck in their past. He gave me hope and redefined how one can retire.

You can only know your limits when you set a benchmark; the same applies to life. So here's a series of questions originating from the same idea (h/t [xan](https://abstractxan.xyz/site/living_the_life_i_havent_seen))

- How do I live the best life ever when I've never seen anyone live it?
- How do I be in a healthy relationship when I've never seen one?
- How do I have a healthy lifestyle when I've never seen one?
- How do I do my life's best work when I've never seen one?
- How do I live a cooperative, equality-based lifestyle when I've never seen one?
- How do I learn healthy intimacy when I've never seen anyone have it?
- How do I fight with anxiety when I've never seen how anyone can win over it?
- How do I balance my life when I've never seen one?
- How do I find my perfect partner when I've never seen anyone have theirs?
- How do I raise my children right when I have never seen any parent raise theirs?
- How do I rest when I've never seen anyone rest leisurely?
- How would I become the best manager when I've never seen the best?
- How would I become a great husband when I've never seen anyone?
