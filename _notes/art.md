title: "Art"

I make doodles, and it's been almost a year since I started them for fun. I visited the Kochi Biennale Art Fest last year, which planted the seed in my head for this habit. It almost felt like watching Pinterest feed on walls. 

As much as I enjoyed the festival, it got me thinking - How doing art 
- helps one to sit with a thought for hours (be it disturbing, suicidal, happy, anxious, or scary)
	- I saw a wall filled with all the paintings a person did for 365 days every day. Throughout it, this person had many disturbing thoughts, and without losing control of the thought, this person just stayed in the moment for hours to create something out of that emotion.
- helps one to be grateful and appreciate all the tiny details
	- After spending hours watching all those paintings, I started having a knack for those tiny details like the arrangement of lines on top of leaves, hair on your skin, texture on your shoes/chappal.

I finished two sketchbooks and made really good progress without knowing much about anything, but now I'm back to basics.
