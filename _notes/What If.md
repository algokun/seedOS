What if, we could copy code directly from videos?

- Ever spent watching a long coding tutorial on YouTube and just wished to pause at some point in the video and run the code from there?
- With Scribma, you can do the same. You can pause at any point in the video and start playing around.

- The tutorial is just a bunch of code snapshots with voice-over. You can pause and interact with the playground.

What if, I could re-write a movie?

- We all felt this need of super power when GoT released the finale. Well, if you think about it, it just boils down to changing a few decisions and letting the story navigate based on that decision.
- To mimic the same, Netflix produced an interactive film, where at every critical turning point of the story, it asks you to choose what should happen next.
