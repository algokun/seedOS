What if, we could copy code directly from videos?

- Ever spent watching a long coding tutorial on YouTube and just wished to pause at some point in the video and run the code from there?
- With Scribma, you can do the same. You can pause at any point in the video and start playing around.

- The tutorial is just a bunch of code snapshots with voice-over. You can pause and interact with the playground.
